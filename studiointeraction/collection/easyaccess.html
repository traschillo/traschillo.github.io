	<p>If you're looking for an addiction that is easily disguisable, easy accessible and easy to abuse, "over the counter" drugs are for you. You may have to take 10 times the reccommended dosage and risk your life, but it's cheap and easy to find. Common forms are cough medicines, cold medicines, motion sickness pills, and pain relievers.<br><br>Every year nearly 80,000 people visit the emergency room due to an "over the counter" drug overdose. Misuse of OTC drugs is most common among teens ages 13-16. </br></br></p>
